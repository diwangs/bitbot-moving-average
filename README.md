# Bitbot 1.0, Moving Average Technique
A simple bitcoin trading bot utilizing bitcoin.co.id API, using two moving averages as a signal. 
This was my early attempt at creating a bitcoin trading bot. 
It only manages to make profit when there's a high surge, so it was discontinued in search of a better algorithm. 
Feel free to judge my code.
